# This code uses the LabJack to record 1 or more voltages at a
# regular cadence. It runs until you stop it with Ctrl-C.
# Edit the values below (above the import u3 statement)
# to match your requirements. Note that the Resolution parameter
# sets the accuracy of the data. The smaller the number, the better
# the accuracy, but the slower the sampling rate must be. See
# http://labjack.com/support/u3/users-guide/3.2 for details.
